            <h4>3.1.4</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The page index now resets in regular mode when any of the filtering parameters is changed.</li>
                <li>The grid no longer waits for the inactivity timeout to request the initial set of items in server-side mode.</li>
                <li>Performance improvements. It's now less likely for the grid to trigger identical data gathering, formatting or filtering operations due to a combination of changes in the watched parameters.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>3.1.2</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug where the default column options were ignored.</li>
                <li>The bower package lists the non-minified versions of the files as main files.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>3.1.0</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Column titles rendering fixed for IE11.</li>
                <li>The grid is now capable of reporting the filtered list of items and the paged items.</li>
                <li>
                    Better handling of data items having field names containing special characters.
                    Do not use data fields having their names starting with '$' as those are being ignored by many of Angular operations.
                </li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where the initial page index was ignored in server side mode.</li>
                <li>
                    <em>data-*</em> notation is accepted for all the attributes.
                    The grid's default templates do not use this notation however.
                </li>
                <li><em>filter-by-fields</em> is now two way data bound, allowing for a full state restoration.</li>
                <li>
                    Limited support for Angular directives on the table row elements (integration with <a ui-sref="demo.tests.xeditable">Angular X-Editable</a> is now possible).
                    DOM altering directives such as <em>ng-repeat</em>, <em>ng-if</em>, <em>ng-switch</em>, are still not supported on the row or cell elements.
                </li>
                <li class="text-warning">
                    Compatibility fixes for Angular 1.3.15.
                    They unfortunately had the side effect of raising the minimum supported version for Angular to 1.3.1.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>3.0.4</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The initial order of items is now maintained.</li>
                <li>An initial order-by is now working even if it was set prior to binding the list of items.</li>
                <li>Sorting now works even when the text inside the column header is clicked in IE9.</li>
                <li>The page index now resets in case one of the column filters, the general filter, or the sort column is changed in server-side mode.</li>
                <li>The number of items per page is properly monitored.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>3.0.2</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a major data binding issue. External scope wasn't getting synchronized with any changes inside the grid's internal scope.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where the grid would error if the bound items array was not initialized.</li>
                <li>Fixed the direction of the sorting chevrons.</li>
                <li>Selection with the SHIFT key when sorting was applied is now working correctly.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>3.0.0</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple types of selection.</li>
                <li>Ability to override the default CSS and templates.</li>
                <li>Better handling of various elements in the header: user experience improved and better monitoring of various column settings.</li>
                <li>Localization support. This doesn't mean though that the grid will provide localized text out of the box.</li>
                <li>jQuery no longer a dependency.</li>
                <li>Filtering uses the display format rather than the original field value.</li>
                <li>Improved pagination.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
